# Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm

## Description
This is a Python implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. The algorithm is used to find the shortest path between a starting vertex and an ending vertex. The algorithm works on both directed and undirected graphs.

## Motivation
I have been hearing about Dijkstra's algorithm for a while now, and once my discrete math class started covering graphs, I decided to implement it. 

I have never used python more than for general scripting, and because I already knew how to implement a graph, I decided now would be a good time to get my hands dirty with python.

## Usage
The program is run from the command line. The program takes in a text file as input. The text file should be formatted as follows:
